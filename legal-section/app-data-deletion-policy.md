# App Data Deletion Policy

## **1. Introduction**

This Data Deletion Policy outlines the procedures and timelines for deleting user and guild ("server") data within the LAPD Central application. The policy aims to comply with applicable data privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

_This policy is subject to change to reflect updates in relevant legislation or our data handling practices._

***

## **2. Data Retention Periods**

### **Guild Data**

* Guild-specific data will be retained for <mark style="color:blue;">a period of 7 days</mark> from the last time the application is active or has been in the guild.
* After the retention period, all guild data, including set configuration, member information, and other related data, will be deleted.

### **User Data**

* User-specific data will be retained for as long as the user's account is active and inside the guild the application is installed on.
* If a user deletes their account or requests their data to be deleted, we will process the request within 7 days and delete the data accordingly.

***

## **3. Data Deletion Procedures**

1.  **Automated Deletion:**

    The application will automatically delete guild data after the specified retention period, currently 7 days after the application is no longer installed on that guild or server.
2.  **User Requests:**

    Users can request the deletion of their personal data by contacting us as outlined in the [Privacy Policy](application-privacy-policy.md#id-6.-contact-information) page.

***

## **4. Data Backup and Archiving**

* For precaution purposes, we may retain a backup of deleted data for a limited period.
* The backup data will be stored securely as possible and subject to the same data protection measures as active data.
