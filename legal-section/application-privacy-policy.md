### Server-Specific Data

When the LAPD Central application is invited to a new Discord server (guild), the following information is automatically collected and stored in our database:

*   **Discord Guild ID** (Server Unique ID):

    The unique identifier (ID) of the Discord server where the application is installed is stored to manage server-specific settings and operations.
* **Server Role, Channel, and Message IDs:**\
  We may store specific IDs, including role and channel IDs, that are either voluntarily provided or automatically captured by the application. These IDs are necessary for the proper functioning of features such as logging channels. Only the message IDs of application-sent messages are stored.
* **Voluntary Server-Specific Logs:**\
  Server members may voluntarily provide logs, which include shift records, leave of absence notices, role-playing duty reports, and other operational logs.

### User-Specific Data

* **Discord User ID:**\
  We store the unique identifier (ID) of users who interact with the application's commands, with certain exceptions, to ensure proper functionality and operation of the services.
* **Roblox Account ID** (voluntarily provided)**:**\
  This ID is collected to facilitate the logging or reporting of role-playing activities and to verify data integrity. Some commands may require users to link their Roblox account for proper execution.
* **Voluntarily Provided Records or Data:**\
  This includes records such as leave of absence notices and shift records as well as their associated information.

### Other Data

Additional data stored by the application may include:

* **Command Usage and Output Errors:**\
  This can include the command name, the user ID of the person who executed the command, the guild ID where the command was executed, the date and time, and any provided inputs. This information is stored temporarily to monitor the application's performance and ensure proper operation.
